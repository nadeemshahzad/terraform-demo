######To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
##### changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
######in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

######You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
######any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
######should now work.
######
######If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
######rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
######commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
